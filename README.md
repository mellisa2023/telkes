# Telkes

Telkes is a proof-of-concept blockchain project designed to **tokenize** renewable energy production. By integrating IoT energy meters with a smart contract, Telkes mints **TELK tokens** for every kilowatt-hour (kWh) generated by solar panels or other clean-energy sources.

Key features:
- **ERC-20 TelkesToken**: Built on OpenZeppelin and deployable via Hardhat or Thirdweb  
- **Dynamic Price Feed Stub**: `getUSDPrice()` returns a demo $1/TELK rate, with owner-updatable `ratePerKWh`  
- **Mining Endpoint**: `/api/mine` serverless function that mints tokens based on submitted kWh readings  
- **IoT-Ready**: Easily integrate with ESP32/Arduino-style devices over HTTP or MQTT to automate mining  
- **Front-end Demo**: React/Next.js UI to connect via MetaMask, display balances, and ‚ÄúMine 1 kWh‚Äù in real time  
- **Local & Testnets**: Runs against Hardhat local node or Goerli/Rinkeby for quick testing  

Whether you‚Äôre a blockchain developer, clean-tech enthusiast, or IoT maker, Telkes shows how to bridge real-world energy data with on-chain token economics.
